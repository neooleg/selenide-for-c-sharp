## WebDriver and Browser Support Warning

Selenium WebDriver doesn't support newest version of browsers out of the box, e.g. Firefox 43+, see details [here (Russian only)](http://selenium2.ru/news/177-firefox47-issue-resolved.html#.V3TQNwkWg5R.facebook).
Thus, both Selenide and Selenide for C# as well will not support newest browsers as soon as they works through Selenium.

## Minimum Software Requirements

1. Visual Studio 2015 (because of C# 6.0)
